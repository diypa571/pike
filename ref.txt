// ************  Data types in Pike


Integer (int): Represents whole numbers, such as -10, 0, 42.

Float (float): Represents floating-point numbers with decimal places, such as 3.14, -0.5, 1.0.

String (string): Represents sequences of characters enclosed in double quotes, such as "Hello", "Pike", "123".

Array (array): Represents an ordered collection of values. Elements in an array can be of any data type, including other arrays.

Mapping (mapping): Represents a set of key-value pairs. Each key in a mapping is unique, and the corresponding value can be accessed using the key.

Object (object): Pike supports object-oriented programming, allowing you to define custom objects with their own properties and methods.

Function (function): Functions in Pike are first-class citizens and can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.

It is often used when a variable needs to store different types of values at different times.

Void (void): Represents the absence of a value.
